    <p>
      Basketball isn’t just a sport for me—it’s a space where I can breathe, think,
      and push myself to be better every day. Every time I step onto the court, it
      feels like everything else fades away. The sound of the ball bouncing, the
      squeak of sneakers, the energy of the game… it all makes me feel alive.
      Whether I’m practicing by myself, running drills with friends, or watching
      some of the greatest players on TV, basketball constantly inspires me to stay
      active, disciplined, and focused. It teaches me teamwork, patience, and hustle.
      And honestly, the court feels like a second home.
